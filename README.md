For instructions on how to install and run Proteus, we refer to [its repository](https://github.com/proteus-core/proteus) and our Dockerfile.

## Running the evaluation

Most of the evaluation steps are implemented in our Dockerfile, which can be run with:

```shell
docker build -t prospect .
docker run -i -t prospect
```

To run the evaluation of the hardware overheads, follow the steps outlined [here](https://github.com/proteus-core/proteus#synthesis), using the `Core.v` files obtained from the Docker container at `/proteus-base/Core.v` and `/prospect/Core.v`.
