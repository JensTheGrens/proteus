For detailed instructions on how to install and use Proteus, we refer to our Dockerfile and the [Proteus repository](https://github.com/proteus-core/proteus).

Repository structure, highlighting the important directories and files:

â”œâ”€â”€ synthesis:  files used for synthesis in Vivado
â”œâ”€â”€ tests:      security tests, benchmarks, RISC-V unit tests

Dockerfile:     Docker script to run the evaluation automatically
sim.gtkw:       waveform view preset for GTKWave
```

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) for installing the core and running the benchmarks.
  + Disk space required for the built container image: 12 GB.
- [Xilinx Vivado](https://www.xilinx.com/products/design-tools/vivado/vivado-ml.html) for running the hardware cost measurements.
  + Requires a Xilinx/AMD account (which you can create for free).
  + Download and run the the installer for [Vivado](https://www.xilinx.com/support/download.html).
  + Select Product to Install: Vivado (ML Standard).
  + Customizing the installation: Vivado Design Suite and the 7 Series Production Devices are sufficient, everything else can be deselected.
  + Disk space required: 52 GB.

**Troubleshooting:**

The Vivado executable file is located at `<installation_directory>/Vivado/<year>/bin/vivado`. If Vivado hangs, or if you get the following error when running Vivado:
`application-specific initialization failed: couldn't load file "librdi_commontasks.so" [...]`, please follow the [instructions on this post](https://support.xilinx.com/s/article/76585).


## Running the evaluation

Most of the evaluation steps are implemented in our Dockerfile, which can be run with:

```shell
docker build -t prospect .
docker run -i -t prospect
```

Building the Docker container takes about 2 hours and requires 7 GB of disk space.

By default, the build process only runs the security tests.
The performance benchmarks can also be run already during the build by adding `--build-arg BENCHMARKS=true` to the build command (this will add 9+ hours to the build process).
This step is optional and the performance benchmarks can still be run later.

### Security tests

The security tests (see start of Section 6.2 in the paper) can be found in `/prospect/tests/spectre-tests/` and can be run with `cd /prospect/tests/spectre-tests/; ./eval.py /proteus-base/sim/build/base /prospect/sim/build/prospect`, where `/proteus-base/sim/build/base` and `/prospect/sim/build/prospect` are the simulator binaries for the base processor and the ProSpeCT-enabled implementation, respectively.

Expected output:

```
TEST secret-before-branch
SECURE VARIANT:  	âœ” Secret did not leak!
INSECURE VARIANT:	ðŸ—² Secret leaked!

TEST secret-after-branch
SECURE VARIANT:  	âœ” Secret did not leak!
INSECURE VARIANT:	ðŸ—² Secret leaked!
```

### Performance benchmarks

Our performance benchmark (see Section 6.2, "Runtime overhead" and Table 1) is located in `/prospect/tests/synthetic-benchmark` and can be run, similar as above, with `./eval.py /proteus-base/sim/build/base_nodump /prospect/sim/build/prospect_nodump`.
This benchmark uses the simulators without VCD dumping, as the generated files would be hundreds of GB in size.

**Important:** Running all simulations takes a long time, on a consumer laptop this is around 9 hours, don't worry if you get no visible progress for a while when running the script.

Expected output:

```
           75      50      25      10
baseline  100%    100%    100%    100%
  p(key)  100%    100%    100%    100%
  p(all)  110%    125%    136%    145%
```

### Hardware overhead

First, find the name of the `prospect` container (`stupefied_poincare` in this example):

```shell
$ docker ps -a
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE          COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS                     PORTS     NAMES
21aa3b3408e6   prospect       "/bin/sh -c /bin/bash"   8 seconds ago    Exited (0) 2 seconds ago             stupefied_poincare

```

Using this name, we can copy the `Core.v` files containing the Verilog design for the base Proteus core and the ProSpeCT-enabled version to the host machine:

```shell
docker cp stupefied_poincare:/proteus-base/Core.v Core.v
docker cp stupefied_poincare:/prospect/Core.v Core-ProSpeCT.v
```

To run the evaluation of the hardware overheads (see Section 6.2, "Hardware cost"), first set up the Vivado project.

#### Creating the Vivado project

1. Launch Vivado, and start the Create Project wizard.
2. Choose the project name and location as desired.
3. Project type: RTL Project.
4. Add sources: select the copied `Core.v` and `synthesis/Top.v`. Do **not** check "Copy sources into project" or "Scan and add RTL include files into project".
5. Add constraints: select `synthesis/Constraints.xdc`.
6. Default part: select your target FPGA, the `xc7a35ticsg324-1L`.
7. Finish the wizard.
8. When the project is open, if `Top.v` is not selected as the top module (shown in bold), right-click on it and "Set as Top".

#### Running the Vivado evaluation

9. Change the timing constraint in `Constraints.xdc` to the value indicated in the paper (`30.1 ns`). As the synthesis process is not completely deterministic, you might need to increase this value slightly if the implementation fails with a failed timing. For example, to change the timing constraint to `30.5 ns`, replace `-period 31.000` in `Constraints.xdc` with `-period 30.500`.
10. Click "Run Implementation" (which will run synthesis first if necessary).
11. Replace `Core.v` with `Core-ProSpeCT.v` on your disk, change the timing constraint in `Constraints.xdc` to the value of ProSpeCT (`30.7 ns`) and rerun the implementation, again adjusting the constraint slightly if necessary.

#### Interpreting the results

When the implementation finishes, the relevant values for number of LUTs and registers can be found on the "Design Runs" tab at the bottom of the screen, in line "impl_1" and in the columns "LUT" and "FF", respectively.
If the timing constraint for the critical path is met, this is shown by a black (and positive) number under the WNS (worst negative slack) field in the same table, failed timings are indicated by an error and a red (negative) WNS number.

#### Expected results

The following results are reported in the paper. Keep in mind that because the synthesis process is not deterministic, results may vary slightly.

|                 |    LUT |     FF |
|-----------------|-------:|-------:|
| Core.v          | 16,847 | 11,913 |
| Core-ProSpeCT.v | 19,728 | 12,600 |
| **Increase**    |   +17% |    +6% |
